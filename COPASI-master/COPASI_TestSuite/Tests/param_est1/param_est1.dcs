Parameter estimation test 1

This is a simple parameter estimation problem of enzyme kinetics progress curve.
It fits two parameters of the Michaelis-Menten mechanism to 5 progress curves.
The problem is set to use the "Levenberg-Marquardt" algorithm. It should 
converge in 290 function evaluations and reach a sum of squares around 12.5015,
though with all optimization algorithms this depends a lot on numerics and is
expected to be slightly different on different platforms. The first two 
parameters should reach values of 26.3663 and 46.696, but note that these can
change more easily than the SSq.
