Creating  the python bindings with SWIG 2.0.4 does not seem to work correctly.
At least the unittests for CCopasiMessasge fail because one of the constructors is not wrapped correctly (at least
not in the same way as with SWIG 1.3.40).
As a workaround, the python bindings should be created with SWIG 1.3.40.
Since I don't think this is a serious issue because one would normally not use the constructor of CCopasiMessage anyway,
this is more or less just a note to explain the failed unit tests when creating the language bindings with SWIG 2.0.4.
